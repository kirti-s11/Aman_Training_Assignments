## Instructions:
- Use Python with Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for all questions.
- Submit both code and plots where required.

---

### Section A: Data Manipulation (Pandas & Numpy)
1. Load the dataset `employee_data.csv` and display the first 5 rows.
2. Find the average salary for each department.
3. Using NumPy, calculate the standard deviation of employee salaries.
4. Add a new column "Seniority" based on:
   - Experience > 5 years → "Senior"
   - Otherwise → "Junior"
5. Find the employee(s) who joined the earliest.

### Section B: Data Visualization (Matplotlib & Seaborn)
6. Plot the distribution of salaries across all employees.
7. Create a bar chart of average salary by department.
8. Show the trend of salaries against joining year using a line plot.
9. Draw a boxplot showing salary distribution across departments.
10. Using Seaborn, visualize the relationship between experience and salary (scatterplot).

### Section C: Advanced/Challenge Questions
11. Identify the department with the highest median salary.
12. Normalize the salary column (0 to 1 scaling) using NumPy.
13. Plot a heatmap of the correlation matrix for all numerical features.
14. Find the top 3 highest-paid employees and plot their salaries in a pie chart.
15. Create a pivot table showing average salary per department grouped by Seniority.

## Deliverables:
- Jupyter Notebook / Python script with answers.
- Visualizations as part of the notebook/script.
